Interpreter Vs Compiler

Interpreter coverts to byte code.
Byte code is quick to convert, but slow to run.

Compiler coverts to machine code.
Machine code is slow to convert, but quick to run.

JIT compiler -> JustInTime compiler. It's a combination of both of the above. It's used in google chrome.
JavaScript uses interpreter.

Interpreted byte code gets converted quickly and runs for a while,then when the machine code is ready by compiler, it starts replacing the byte code of interpreter by inspector.
